# Movies App - README

## Description

The Movies App is an Android application developed in Kotlin that allows users to search for their favorite movies, view their detailed information, and add them to their favorites. The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern and uses several widely-used Jetpack libraries, including Retrofit, Room Database, Dependency Injection with Hilt, Data Binding, Navigation, Glide, and Paging 3.

## Features

The Movies App comes with the following features:

- Search for movies: Users can search for movies by their title.

- Add to favorites: Users can add a movie to their favorites list for easy access later.
- Remove from favorites: Users can remove a movie from their favorites list if they no longer wish to keep it.
- Paging: The app uses Paging 3 to paginate search results, making it easier to load large amounts of data in a performant manner.
- Data binding: The app uses data binding to minimize boilerplate code and improve code readability.
- Dependency injection with Hilt: The app uses Hilt for dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies and improve code modularity.
- Room Database: The app uses Room Database to store user favorites in a local database, making it easier to access the data without requiring an internet connection.
